  <h1>I'm a Visual Studio guy but I'm trying to learn neovim by myself when I have the time</h1>
  <h2>Here are some commands I know by know. Not a lot rn, but at least I know THE FORBIDDEN ONE</h2>
  <pre>
    <code lang="bash">
      >:q! - # Quit without saving. The forbidden one. The end to all I can't exit Vim jokes
      >:wq - # Write and quit. Really useful
      >:w - # Write. Plain. Useful
      >:q - # Quit. Useful when you have saved
      >A - # Append at the end of the line and enter insert mode. I think it's one of the best
      >I - # Insert at the beginning of the line and enter insert mode. Really damn good imo
      >a - # Append after the cursor and enter insert mode. Plain & useful
      >0 - # Go to the beginning of the line. Could be useful? Idk tbh
      >h j k l Move the cursor 1 position to the left, down, up and right respectively. "Blazingly fast"
      >:checkhealth - # Check the "health" of neovim. Useful when installing plugins
      >:PlugInstall - # Install plugins. Create your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg">"PDE" (Personal Development Environment</a>) now!
